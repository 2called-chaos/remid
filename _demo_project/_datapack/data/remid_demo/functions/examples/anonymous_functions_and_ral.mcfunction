# Anonymous functions are primarily to workaround some read- and workability issues with vanilla
# especially when caring about performance.


# Imagine you want to execute 3 commands in a given environment. For performance reasons (as to
# not reevaluate selectors multiple times) it is advised to move these 3 commands into a function.
#
# But this easily makes it hard to follow what is going on. Now figure this:
execute as @e[tag=expensive_selector] at @s run function remid_demo:examples/anonymous_functions_and_ral/__anon_9_1
# This will automatically create an unnamed function (well technically it has a name but you know)
# and directly references it as function call.


# You can also nest this and do all sort of things, a more complicated example
execute as @e[tag=expensive_selector] at @s run function remid_demo:examples/anonymous_functions_and_ral/__anon_19_1





# RAL (Repeat A Lineâ„¢) is basically the same as an anonymous function except it actually just repeats
# the previous line. So less repetition, no performance gain. Fortunately you just need to add 2 characters
# to make it an anonymous function. But this can be used for different scenarios, like:
say [Some Prefix] hello there
say [Some Prefix] please leave a like
